# Fostr Fix — Technical TODO

Status legend: `[ ]` not started · `[~]` partial (UI exists, no backend) · `[x]` done

---

## 1. Onboarding & Profile Creation

- [x] Shelter onboarding form — `insert` into `shelters` (slug + random suffix, `user_id` from session)
- [x] Foster onboarding form — `insert` into `foster_parents`
- [x] Post-login role detection — `getPostAuthDestination()` in `src/lib/auth-routing.ts`; login redirects to `/shelter/dashboard`, `/foster/browse`, or `/onboarding`
- [x] Google OAuth callback — `src/app/auth/callback/route.ts` exchanges code, then same role-based redirect (configure provider + redirect URL in Supabase dashboard)

## 2. Dog CRUD (Shelter Side)

- [x] Create dog — `DogForm` inserts into `dogs` with `shelter_id` from session
- [x] Edit dog — edit page loads dog via `select`; `DogForm` updates row
- [x] List dogs — `/shelter/dogs` loads `dogs` for the signed-in shelter
- [x] Delete dog — `DogDeleteButton` → `DELETE /api/dogs/[id]`; shelter ownership; 409 if active applications block deletion
- [ ] Dog photo upload — file input renders; `/api/upload/photo` is a stub; needs FormData parsing, resize, Supabase Storage upload
- [ ] Photo preview/reorder in `DogForm`
- [ ] Dog status transitions (available → pending → placed) — no toggle/control in UI

## 3. Browse & Search (Foster Side)

- [x] Browse dogs page — Supabase `select` from `dogs` where `status = 'available'`, nested `shelters` for name/logo (DEV_MODE still uses placeholders)
- [x] Filter sidebar — filters fetched rows client-side (size, age, gender, medical needs); URL query params synced via `useSearchParams` + `router.replace`
- [ ] Distance-based search — schema has lat/lng; needs haversine/PostGIS query
- [ ] Pagination / infinite scroll
- [x] Dog detail page — `select` dog + shelter by id; apply flow uses real `shelter_id`

## 4. Applications

- [x] Apply for dog — `insert` into `applications` (`submitted`, `note`, `foster_id` / `dog_id` / `shelter_id`)
- [x] Foster "My Applications" page — server-fetches `applications` joined with `dogs` + `shelters`; tab filtering via `FosterApplicationsList` client component
- [x] Shelter "Applications" page — server-fetches `applications` joined with `dogs` + `foster_parents`; tab filtering via `ShelterApplicationsList` client component
- [x] Application detail (shelter) — real fetch with joins; `FosterProfileView` with ratings; `ShelterNoteEditor` for internal notes
- [x] Shelter internal notes — `ShelterNoteEditor` client component saves `shelter_note` on submit via Supabase
- [x] Accept application — `AcceptDeclineButtons` calls `/api/applications/[id]/accept`; auth + ownership + idempotency guard; sets dog → `pending`
- [x] Decline application — same pattern; sets application → `declined`; dog stays `available`
- [x] Complete foster — "Mark Complete" button (shown when `accepted`); sets application → `completed` + dog → `placed`
- [x] Status change side effects: accepting sets dog → `pending`, completing sets dog → `placed`

## 5. API Routes

- [x] `POST /api/applications/[id]/accept` — auth check, verify shelter ownership, idempotency guard, update status + dog → pending
- [x] `POST /api/applications/[id]/decline` — auth check, verify shelter ownership, idempotency guard, update status
- [x] `POST /api/applications/[id]/complete` — auth check, verify shelter ownership, idempotency guard, update status + dog → placed
- [ ] `POST /api/notifications/send` — Resend integration (code is commented out), email templates
- [ ] `POST /api/upload/photo` — auth check, FormData parse, image resize, Supabase Storage upload, return public URL
- [x] `POST /api/ratings` — auth, completed application, shelter ownership, idempotent insert
- [x] `DELETE /api/dogs/[id]` — auth, shelter ownership, guard against deleting dogs tied to active applications

## 6. Messaging

- [x] Message thread pages (foster + shelter) — server fetch application + messages; `MessageThread` client for send/display; DEV_MODE placeholder when no Supabase URL
- [x] Send message — `MessageThread` inserts into `messages` with `sender_id` / `sender_role`; optimistic UI
- [x] Fetch messages — server `select` by `application_id`, ordered for display; initial props mirrored after mark-as-read `UPDATE` so client state matches DB
- [x] Message list pages — server-fetched threads (accepted/completed apps) with last message preview + per-thread unread badges
- [ ] Supabase Realtime subscription — subscribe to `postgres_changes` on `messages` for live updates without refresh
- [x] Unread message count / indicators — layouts count unread (by role); thread list badges; nav badge via `portal-nav`
- [x] Mark messages as read on open — server marks other-party unread rows when thread loads; RLS allows `UPDATE (read)` only (see migrations `20240103000000`, `20240104000000`)

## 7. Ratings & Reviews

- [x] Rating submission after foster completion — `RatingDialog` from `AcceptDeclineButtons`; optional prompt after "Mark Complete"; "Rate Foster" on completed applications when no rating yet (`hasExistingRating` from application detail query)
- [x] `StarRating` — wired in `RatingDialog` for score selection
- [x] `insert` into `ratings` — `POST /api/ratings` with Zod validation, shelter ownership, idempotency
- [x] Display average rating on foster profile — application detail / profile views use existing data + `calculateAverageRating` where applicable
- [~] Rating history on foster history page — completed apps + ratings shown; further polish optional

## 8. Profile Management

- [x] Foster profile page — server-fetches `foster_parents` row; `FosterProfileForm` client component upserts via Supabase; Sonner toasts
- [x] Shelter settings page — server-fetches `shelters` row; `ShelterSettingsForm` client component updates via Supabase; Sonner toasts
- [ ] Avatar/logo upload — file inputs exist (disabled); needs Supabase Storage wiring
- [x] `ProfileCompleteness` component — reads from server-fetched data passed via props

## 9. Dashboard (Shelter)

- [x] Dashboard page — server-fetches real counts (active dogs, pending apps, unread messages) and last 5 applications with joins
- [x] Fetch active dog count (`select count` from `dogs` where shelter + available)
- [x] Fetch pending application count (submitted + reviewing)
- [x] Fetch recent applications list (last 5 with `ApplicationCard`)
- [x] Fetch unread message count

## 10. Foster History

- [x] History page — server-fetches completed `applications` joined with `dogs` + `shelters`; separate ratings query
- [x] `FosterHistoryCard` component wired with real data + optional rating display
- [x] Stats: total placements + average rating computed via `calculateAverageRating`

## 11. Email Notifications (Resend)

- [ ] Set up Resend API key (currently placeholder in `.env.local`)
- [ ] Application submitted → email shelter
- [ ] Application accepted → email foster
- [ ] Application declined → email foster
- [ ] Foster completed → email both parties
- [ ] New message → email recipient (debounced)
- [ ] Email templates (HTML) for each notification type

## 12. Photo & File Storage

- [ ] Supabase Storage upload helper (shared across dog photos, logos, avatars)
- [ ] Image resize/optimization before upload
- [ ] Storage bucket RLS policies (currently buckets exist but no access policies)
- [ ] Delete old photos on replacement
- [ ] Max file size validation client-side

## 13. Security & Edge Cases

- [x] RLS recursion fix — `SECURITY DEFINER` helpers (`get_my_foster_ids`, `get_my_shelter_ids`) break circular policy deps (migration `20240102000000`)
- [x] Messages mark-as-read hardening — column-scoped `UPDATE (read)` + tightened policy so participants cannot edit message body or sender columns (migration `20240104000000`)
- [x] Verify application ownership before status changes (all three API routes check shelter `user_id`)
- [ ] Rate limiting on API routes
- [ ] Input sanitization on all user-submitted text (XSS prevention)
- [x] Prevent duplicate applications (same foster + same dog) — dog detail page checks for existing application on load; button disabled if already applied
- [ ] Handle expired/revoked sessions gracefully
- [ ] CSRF protection on mutation endpoints

## 14. UX Polish

- [x] Toast notifications on success/error for all mutations (Sonner wired on profiles, application actions, internal notes)
- [x] Confirmation dialogs before destructive actions (accept/decline/complete use `AlertDialog`)
- [x] Loading skeletons on data-fetching pages — `loading.tsx` for dashboard, applications, history, messages (both portals); inline skeletons for browse grid and dog detail
- [x] Mobile navigation — `MobileNav` + `Sheet` in `portal-nav.tsx` (foster + shelter layouts)
- [x] Active nav link highlighting — `usePathname` in `portal-nav.tsx`
- [~] Empty state components — used on browse, shelter dogs, applications, dashboard, history
- [ ] Form error display improvements
- [x] Optimistic UI updates for messaging — `MessageThread` appends sent messages before insert completes

## 15. Infrastructure

- [ ] Environment variable validation on startup
- [ ] Error boundary improvements (`error.tsx` exists but is generic)
- [ ] Sentry or equivalent error tracking
- [ ] Analytics (PostHog, Mixpanel, etc.)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Production deployment (Vercel)
- [ ] Database backups strategy
- [ ] Seed script for development data

---

## 16. Auth — Critical Gaps

- [ ] **Sign-out button** — no sign-out exists anywhere in either portal layout or nav; users cannot log out; add `supabase.auth.signOut()` + redirect to `/` in both sidebars and mobile sheets
- [ ] **Forgot password / reset password flow** — login page has no "Forgot password?" link; implement `supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail()` + a `/auth/reset-password` callback route that handles the magic-link token and lets the user set a new password
- [ ] **Email verification handling** — after `signUp()` Supabase sends a confirmation email but the app immediately redirects to `/onboarding` with no check on `email_confirmed_at`; add a `/auth/confirm` route handler and an "please verify your email" interstitial

## 17. Foster Dashboard

- [ ] Foster home / dashboard page at `/foster/dashboard` — show active application count, current fostering placements, unread messages badge, and recent application cards (mirrors the shelter dashboard pattern)
- [ ] Redirect foster post-login to `/foster/dashboard` instead of `/foster/browse`
- [ ] Add Dashboard nav item to `FOSTER_NAV` in `portal-nav.tsx`

## 18. Application Workflow Gaps

- [ ] **"Reviewing" status transition** — DB supports `submitted → reviewing → accepted/declined` but there is no shelter UI button to move an application to `reviewing`; add a "Mark as Reviewing" action to `AcceptDeclineButtons` + a `POST /api/applications/[id]/review` route
- [ ] **Foster application withdrawal** — foster parents have no way to cancel a `submitted` or `reviewing` application; add a "Withdraw Application" button on the foster application detail/list + `DELETE /api/applications/[id]` (guard: only when status is `submitted` or `reviewing`)
- [ ] **"View Conversation" link from application pages** — shelter application detail and foster application list have no direct link to the message thread; add a "Message" button linking to `/shelter/messages/[applicationId]` or `/foster/messages/[applicationId]` when the application is accepted/completed

## 19. Dog & Shelter Management Gaps

- [ ] **Manual dog status override** — if an accepted placement falls through, shelters have no way to reset a dog from `pending` back to `available`; add a status dropdown or "Re-list Dog" action on the edit dog page + a `PATCH /api/dogs/[id]/status` route
- [ ] **Shelter placed/completed dogs history** — `/shelter/dogs` only shows active dogs; add a "Placed" tab or separate page listing dogs with `status = 'placed'` and their associated completed application records

## 20. Browse & Discovery Gaps

- [ ] **Text / keyword / breed search** — the filter sidebar has no free-text input; add a search box that filters by dog `name` and `breed` (client-side against loaded data or a Supabase `ilike` query)
- [ ] **Pre-populate browse filters from foster preferences** — `foster_parents` has `pref_size`, `pref_age`, and `pref_medical` columns collected during onboarding but browse never uses them; on first load (no URL params), initialise `FilterState` from the signed-in foster's saved preferences
- [ ] **Public shelter profile page** — dog cards show the shelter name but it is not clickable; add a `/shelter/[slug]` public page showing shelter bio, logo, location, and active listings so fosters can vet a shelter before applying
- [ ] **Pagination on all list pages** — pagination is noted for browse only; shelter applications, foster applications, shelter dogs, and message thread lists all fetch all records; add cursor/page-based pagination or infinite scroll

## 21. Account Settings

- [ ] **Change password** — no auth-level account settings page exists; add `/account/settings` (or extend shelter settings / foster profile) with a "Change Password" section calling `supabase.auth.updateUser({ password })`
- [ ] **Change email** — similarly, users cannot update their login email; add an email-change form that calls `supabase.auth.updateUser({ email })` and handles the re-confirmation flow
- [ ] **Account deletion** — users cannot delete their accounts; required by GDPR / CCPA; add a "Delete Account" danger-zone section that anonymises profile data, cancels active applications, and calls `supabase.auth.admin.deleteUser()` via a server action

## 22. Two-Way Trust & Ratings

- [ ] **Foster-to-shelter ratings** — only shelters can rate foster parents; add a reverse rating flow so fosters can rate their shelter experience after a completed placement; requires a new `shelter_ratings` table (or a `rater_role` column on `ratings`) + `POST /api/shelter-ratings`
- [ ] **Shelter verification workflow** — `shelters.is_verified` is always `false`; add a verification request button on shelter settings, an admin review queue, and surface the verified badge on shelter profiles and dog listings

## 23. Collaboration & Scale

- [ ] **Shelter multi-staff access** — each shelter is bound to a single `user_id`; add a `shelter_members` join table with roles (owner / staff) + an invitation flow so multiple staff can manage the same shelter account
- [ ] **In-app notification center** — the only notification surface is the unread message badge; add a notification bell + dropdown/page for events like "your application was accepted," "a foster applied to your dog," and "new message received" backed by a `notifications` table

## 24. Legal & Compliance

- [ ] **Terms of Service page** — no legal pages exist; add `/terms` with ToS content; link from signup and footer
- [ ] **Privacy Policy page** — add `/privacy` covering data collected (location, housing info, children/pets details, EIN); link from signup and footer
- [ ] **Terms acceptance on signup** — add a required checkbox on the signup form confirming the user accepts the ToS and Privacy Policy; store acceptance timestamp on the user record

---

## 25. UI/UX Aesthetic Overhaul

> The platform currently uses the default shadcn/ui slate-navy theme with no custom typography, no brand personality, and minimal visual hierarchy. Everything below is aesthetic-first — the goal is to feel warm, trustworthy, and purpose-built for animal rescue, not like a generic SaaS tool.

### 25a. Brand Identity & Design Tokens

- [ ] **Replace primary color with a warm brand palette** — the current `--primary: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%` (cold dark navy) reads as corporate; swap to a warm, approachable palette (e.g. a deep amber-brown primary with a complementary soft sage or terracotta accent) that reflects care and warmth without being childish; update all HSL tokens in `globals.css`
- [ ] **Add a custom Google Font pairing** — import a friendly but refined heading font (e.g. *DM Sans*, *Plus Jakarta Sans*, or *Nunito*) for `h1`–`h3` and keep Inter or the system stack for body; set `font-family` on the `html` element and configure the Tailwind `fontFamily` extension so `font-display` and `font-body` utilities are available
- [ ] **Increase `--radius` to `0.75rem`** — the current `0.5rem` feels stiff; rounder corners soften the UI and are consistent with modern consumer apps; cascade through card, input, badge, button, and dialog radius tokens
- [ ] **Define a semantic color for "warm accent"** — add a `--warm` token (warm amber/honey) used for highlights, active states, and the paw/brand icon; prevents the icon from being the same navy as text
- [ ] **Add a subtle background texture or tint** — replace the flat `--background: 0 0% 100%` with a very faint warm off-white (e.g. `30 20% 99%`) so the page doesn't feel stark white; similarly shift `--muted` to a warm cream rather than the current cool gray
- [ ] **Dark mode design pass** — the dark mode CSS variables exist but are untouched default shadcn values; once the light palette is set, calibrate the dark equivalents so dark mode feels intentionally designed, not auto-inverted

### 25b. Landing Page

- [ ] **Hero section redesign** — replace the centered icon-on-a-circle with a full-bleed asymmetric layout: large headline on the left, a real dog photography placeholder (or illustrated scene) on the right; add a warm gradient wash behind the headline instead of the flat `bg-gradient-to-b from-background to-muted`
- [ ] **Animated headline or subtle entrance** — add a fade-up entrance animation on the hero headline and subtext using `tailwindcss-animate` (`animate-fade-in` with staggered delays) so the page feels alive on first load
- [ ] **Social proof / stats bar** — add a row of trust signals below the CTA buttons (e.g. "2,400+ dogs fostered · 180+ partner shelters · ★ 4.9 avg foster rating") in a muted banner strip; even as placeholder copy it signals maturity
- [ ] **"How It Works" step cards** — replace the three plain icon circles with illustrated or icon-rich cards that have a number badge, a more descriptive graphic, and a subtle background tint per step; give them a border and shadow-sm so they read as cards, not floating text
- [ ] **Shelter logo marquee / "trusted by" row** — add a horizontally scrolling strip of placeholder shelter logos or silhouettes above the footer to convey legitimacy
- [ ] **Footer redesign** — replace the single copyright line with a two-column footer containing nav links (About, Terms, Privacy, Contact), social icons, and the brand lockup; the current footer is invisible on most screens

### 25c. Navigation & Portal Sidebar

- [ ] **User identity in the sidebar footer** — replace `<p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground px-3">Shelter Portal</p>` with an avatar + display name + role pill pulled from the session, and a sign-out button as an icon; this is the most glaring missing affordance in both portals
- [ ] **Sidebar active state redesign** — the current active state is `bg-accent` (same gray as muted) with no color differentiation; replace with a warm-tinted pill (`bg-primary/10 text-primary font-semibold`) plus a left-border accent bar so the active page is unmistakeable
- [ ] **Sidebar brand lockup** — the `PawPrint` icon next to "Fostr Fix" in the sidebar header is the same size and color as the nav icons below it; make the brand treatment larger, give the paw a warm color, and separate it visually with more padding so it reads as a logo not a nav item
- [ ] **Micro-transitions on nav items** — add `transition-all duration-150` with a subtle `translate-x-0.5` on hover so links feel interactive; currently only `transition-colors` is applied
- [ ] **Unread badge pulse animation** — add a `animate-pulse` ring on the unread message badge when count > 0 to draw attention without being disruptive

### 25d. Dog Cards (Browse Grid)

- [ ] **"No photo" placeholder redesign** — the current placeholder is a flat gray box with "No photo" text in the center; replace with a warm gradient fill + a centered illustrated dog silhouette SVG (or a `PawPrint` icon at larger size with opacity) so cards without photos still feel intentional
- [ ] **Card hover state** — replace `hover:shadow-md transition-shadow` with a richer hover: `hover:shadow-lg hover:-translate-y-1 transition-all duration-200`; currently the shadow change is barely perceptible
- [ ] **Photo aspect ratio + object-position** — the photo area is a fixed `h-52` div; use a `aspect-[4/3]` approach instead so cards are consistent regardless of uploaded image dimensions; add `object-position: center top` to favor the dog's face
- [ ] **Badge styling** — the size/age/gender badges use `variant="secondary"` (light gray); replace with colored variants: warm amber for age, teal/sage for size, soft pink/blue for gender; add a small relevant icon inside each badge (e.g. `Ruler` for size, `Calendar` for age)
- [ ] **"View Dog" button** — the full-width dark button at the bottom of every card is heavy; replace with a lighter `variant="ghost"` or outlined button with an arrow icon, or remove the button entirely and make the whole card a link with a visible arrow chevron on hover
- [ ] **Shelter name treatment on card** — the `MapPin` + shelter name is currently 3px of muted text; upgrade to show the shelter's logo avatar (tiny, 16px) inline next to the shelter name for recognisability
- [ ] **Special needs indicator** — if `dog.special_needs` is set, surface a small "Special needs" badge or heart icon on the card photo corner (top-right overlay) so it's visible at a glance in the grid

### 25e. Browse Page Layout

- [ ] **Sticky filter sidebar** — the filter sidebar scrolls away with the page; add `sticky top-6` so filters stay in view while browsing the grid
- [ ] **Filter sidebar as floating card** — wrap the filter sidebar in a `Card` with `shadow-sm` and `rounded-xl` so it has visual weight and looks like a panel, not bare text on the page background
- [ ] **Filter chips / pill selectors** — replace the checkbox lists for Size and Age with horizontal pill/chip toggle buttons (outlined → filled on select) which are more mobile-friendly and visually legible; keep checkboxes only for the binary medical toggle
- [ ] **Results count + active filter chips** — show a "12 dogs found" count above the grid with removable chips for each active filter so users can see and undo filters without scrolling back to the sidebar
- [ ] **Mobile filter sheet** — on small screens the 64-width sidebar is hidden but there is no "Filter" button to access it; add a floating `Filter` pill button fixed to the bottom of the screen on mobile that opens a `Sheet` containing the filter sidebar

### 25f. Application & Status Cards

- [ ] **Status badge color coding** — `StatusBadge` currently maps all statuses to generic variants; create a proper color scheme: `submitted` → blue, `reviewing` → amber, `accepted` → green, `declined` → red, `completed` → purple; add an icon per status (Clock, Eye, CheckCircle, XCircle, Award)
- [ ] **Application card visual hierarchy** — the `ApplicationCard` shows avatar + name + dog name as flat text; add a right-side arrow chevron to indicate it's clickable, and use `font-semibold` for the dog's name to create clear hierarchy
- [ ] **Foster application status card** — add a progress-step indicator (submitted → reviewing → accepted/declined → completed) as a horizontal stepper on the foster's application detail view so they can visually track where their application is
- [ ] **Accepted application highlight** — give accepted applications a green-tinted card border (`border-l-4 border-l-green-500`) on list views to make them immediately identifiable

### 25g. Empty States

- [ ] **Illustrated empty states** — all empty states currently show plain text with no visual; add a unique SVG illustration or icon composition per context (e.g. a sleepy dog for "no applications", a magnifying glass with paw for "no dogs match filters", a speech bubble for "no messages")
- [ ] **Empty state CTA buttons** — the `EmptyState` component already has an optional `action` prop; audit all usages and ensure every empty state has a relevant CTA with a primary button (e.g. "Browse Dogs" on the empty applications page, "Add your first dog" on the shelter dogs page)

### 25h. Forms & Inputs

- [ ] **Input focus ring** — the default focus ring uses `--ring` (same dark navy as the text); replace with a warm-colored focus ring (`ring-primary/50` or the new `--warm` token) so focused inputs are clearly highlighted
- [ ] **Section headers inside forms** — `CardTitle` headings like "Personal Info" and "Foster Preferences" are plain `font-semibold` text; add a colored left-border accent line or a small icon before each section title to create visual anchoring
- [ ] **Avatar upload area redesign** — the current upload area is a `h-16 w-16` circle with an `Upload` icon; replace with a dashed-border drop zone (`border-2 border-dashed border-muted-foreground/30 hover:border-primary`) that shows a preview when a file is selected, and a subtle "Drag & drop or click to upload" label
- [ ] **Inline field validation styling** — required fields have no visual indicator (no asterisk, no color); add a subtle red `*` after required labels and a green checkmark icon that appears inside the input when the field is valid
- [ ] **Profile completeness bar** — the `ProfileCompleteness` banner is plain muted/border; restyle it as a warm amber/honey banner with a progress bar that fills with the warm accent color and animated transitions when new fields are completed
- [ ] **Floating save button** — on long forms (foster profile, shelter settings) the save button is at the very bottom and requires scrolling; add a sticky `bottom-0` save bar that appears once the user has made a change (dirty state detection)

### 25i. Dashboard (Shelter)

- [ ] **Stat card visual lift** — the three stat cards (`Active Listings`, `Pending Applications`, `Unread Messages`) are white cards with a large number and a tiny muted icon; add a colored icon background pill per stat (teal for dogs, amber for applications, blue for messages), a subtle trend indicator (arrow + % vs last week, even as placeholder), and increase the number to `text-4xl font-extrabold`
- [ ] **Dashboard greeting** — add a personalised greeting at the top (`Good morning, Happy Paws 👋`) pulled from the shelter name and current time; small detail, large impact on warmth
- [ ] **Recent applications section** — the list of `ApplicationCard` components has no visual "section card" wrapper; wrap it in a `Card` with a `CardHeader` that includes a "View all" link so the section feels intentional and contained

### 25j. Messaging

- [ ] **Message bubble styling** — outgoing and incoming messages are presumably rendered as flat text rows; style them as chat bubbles with background fills (primary-tinted for outgoing, muted for incoming), border-radius `rounded-2xl rounded-br-sm` for sent and `rounded-2xl rounded-bl-sm` for received, and sender avatar on incoming
- [ ] **Thread list previews** — message thread list items should show a truncated last message body, a relative timestamp ("2 min ago"), and a bolder unread indicator (full background tint on unread rows, not just a badge)
- [ ] **Typing indicator placeholder** — add a "..." animated bubble that can be wired to Realtime when that is implemented; even as a static decoration in the interim it signals the design intent
- [ ] **Empty message thread state** — when a thread has no messages yet (just accepted), show a warm illustrated placeholder ("Say hello to get the conversation started") instead of a blank white area

### 25k. Onboarding Flow

- [ ] **Role selection cards redesign** — the two role cards ("I'm a Shelter" / "I'm a Foster Parent") are basic bordered cards; redesign with a full-bleed illustrated header image per role (shelter building vs. cosy home), bolder headline, bullet list of what you can do, and a bottom CTA; add a `hover:scale-[1.02]` transform and a heavier border on hover
- [ ] **Multi-step progress indicator** — add a horizontal step indicator (Step 1 of 2: Choose Role → Step 2: Create Profile) above the form so users know how much onboarding is left
- [ ] **Shelter form visual grouping** — the shelter onboarding form is one flat column of inputs; group them into visual clusters (Basic Info, Contact, Online Presence) with thin dividers and subsection labels

### 25l. Micro-interactions & Motion

- [ ] **Page transition** — add a subtle `opacity-0 → opacity-100` fade on route change using a layout-level animation wrapper so navigating between pages feels smooth rather than an instant flash
- [ ] **Button loading state** — buttons in loading state currently just change label text; add an inline `Loader2` spinning icon (from lucide) before the label so the affordance is clearer
- [ ] **Card entrance animations** — dog browse cards, application cards, and dashboard stat cards should fade-and-slide-up on mount using `animate-fade-in` with staggered `animation-delay` based on index, so grids don't pop in all at once
- [ ] **Toast redesign** — Sonner toasts are styled by default; customise with the brand palette — success toasts with a warm green + paw checkmark icon, error toasts with a muted red, info toasts with the brand warm color

### 25m. Accessibility & Responsive Polish

- [ ] **Keyboard focus visibility** — run through all interactive elements; many shadcn defaults have `focus-visible:ring-2` but the ring color (dark navy on white) has low contrast ratio; switch to a high-contrast ring using the new warm accent token
- [ ] **Responsive browse layout** — on screens between `sm` and `md` the filter sidebar and grid are squeezed into a cramped two-column layout; add a collapsible sidebar toggle at the `md` breakpoint so the grid can use full width when filters are hidden
- [ ] **Mobile form inputs** — all inputs are `h-10` (40px) which can be too small on touch devices; ensure inputs are at least `h-11` (44px) on mobile via responsive classes and that tap targets for checkboxes and radio buttons are at least 44×44px
- [ ] **Print stylesheet** — `/shelter/applications/[id]` and foster profiles are the kind of pages shelter staff may want to print; add a `@media print` block that hides the nav, action buttons, and sidebar and formats the content as a clean single-column document
